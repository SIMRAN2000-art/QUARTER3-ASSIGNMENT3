# What is multi threading?
Multi threading allow us to process multiple threads simultaneously.all threads occur in same process,it improve stability of our program,In multi threading each thread work independently,if we have error in our one thread then it would not effect on the rest of program.
## for example:
In vlc  media player we use three threads simultaneously one for open VLC
media player,second for play song and third for add new song.
